# ðŸŒŒ The A Dream  

**The A Dream** is an immersive 3D narrative-driven game built with **Unity** and powered by an AI-driven dialogue system. The player follows **Acool**, the main character, through a dynamic open-world village where every NPC responds with context-aware, lifelike conversations.  

This project integrates **transformer-based NLP models** (trained in the backend) with real-time Unity gameplay to deliver **adaptive NPC behavior** and enhance player immersion.

## ðŸŽ® Features  
- **AI-Powered NPCs** â€” NPCs respond contextually using a fine-tuned transformer model.  
- **Dynamic World State** â€” Player actions influence NPC attitudes and rumor spread.  
- **Unity 3D Environment** â€” Custom-built environment for an open-world village feel.  
- **Seamless Backend Integration** â€” Python backend with Hugging Face Transformers for real-time dialogue generation.  
- **Custom Data** â€” Trained on bespoke dialogue datasets matching the gameâ€™s tone and lore.
